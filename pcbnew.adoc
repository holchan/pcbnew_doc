NOTE: This manual is in the process of being revised to cover the latest stable
      release version of KiCad.  It contains some sections that have not yet
      been completed.  We ask for your patience while our volunteer technical
      writers work on this task, and we welcome new contributors who would like
      to help make KiCad's documentation better than ever.
