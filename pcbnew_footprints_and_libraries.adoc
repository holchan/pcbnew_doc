== Footprints and footprint libraries

KiCad organizes footprints into footprint libraries, which hold collections of
footprints. Each footprint in a board is uniquely identified by a full name that
is composed of a library nickname and a footprint name. For example, the
identifier `Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric` refers to the `C_0603_1608Metric`
footprint in the `Capacitor_SMD` library.

[[managing-footprint-libraries]]
=== Managing footprint libraries

KiCad uses a table of footprint libraries to map footprint libraries of any
supported library type to a library nickname. KiCad uses a global footprint
library table as well as a table specific to each project. To edit either
footprint library table, use **Preferences** -> **Manage Footprint
Libraries...**.

image::images/en/fp_lib_table.png[scaledwidth="80%",alt="footprint library table dialog"]

The global footprint library table contains the list of libraries that are
always available regardless of the currently loaded project. The table is
saved in the file `fp-lib-table` in the KiCad configuration folder.
xref:../kicad/kicad.adoc#config-file-location[The location of this folder]
depends on the operating system being used.

The project specific footprint library table contains the list of libraries that
are available specifically for the currently loaded project. If there are any
project-specific footprint libraries, the table is saved in the file
`fp-lib-table` in the project folder.

KiCad's footprint library management system allows directly using many types
of footprint libraries, including formats that are native to other non-KiCad EDA
tools:

* KiCad `.pretty` footprint libraries
  (folders with `.pretty` extension, containing `.kicad_mod` files)
* KiCad Legacy footprint libraries (`.mod` files)
* Altium Designer (`.PcbLib` or `.IntLib` files)
* CADSTAR PCB Archive (`.cpa` files)
* Eagle footprint libraries (`.lbr` files)
* EasyEDA / JLCEDA Standard Edition (`.json` or `.zip` files)
* EasyEDA / JLCEDA Professional Edition (`.elibz`, `.epro`, or `.zip` files)
* GEDA libraries  (folders containing `.fp` files)

Non-KiCad footprint libraries, including KiCad Legacy footprint libraries, can
be migrated to KiCad `.pretty` format using the **Migrate Libraries** button
(see the <<migrating-footprint-libraries,migrating libraries>> section).

NOTE: KiCad only supports writing to KiCad's native `.pretty` format footprint
libraries (and the `.kicad_mod` footprint files within them). All other
footprint library formats are read-only. To modify a non-KiCad format footprint
library, you must first convert it to KiCad format.

==== Initial Configuration

The first time the PCB Editor (or any other KiCad tool that uses footprints) runs
and the global footprint table file `fp-lib-table` is not found, KiCad will
guide the user through setting up a new footprint library table. This process is
described <<initial-configuration,above>>. You can re-run this process at any
time by clicking the **Reset Libraries**.

WARNING: Resetting your footprint library table will permanently change your
         footprint library table on disk.



==== Managing Table Entries

Footprint libraries can only be used if they have been added to either the
global or project-specific footprint library table.

Add a library either by clicking the
image:images/icons/small_folder_16.png[Folder icon] button and selecting a
library or clicking the image:images/icons/small_plus_16.png[Plus icon] button
and typing the path to a library file. The selected library will be added to the
currently opened library table (Global or Project Specific). Libraries can be
removed by selecting desired library entries and clicking the
image:images/icons/small_trash_16.png[Delete icon] button.

The image:images/icons/small_up_16.png[Up icon] and
image:images/icons/small_down_16.png[Down icon] buttons move the selected
library up and down in the library table. This does not affect the display order
of libraries in the Footprint Library Browser, Footprint Editor, or Add
Footprint tool.

Libraries can be made inactive by unchecking the *Active* checkbox in the first
column. Inactive libraries are still in the library table but do not appear in
any library browsers and are not loaded from disk, which can reduce loading
times.

A range of libraries can be selected by clicking the first library in the range
and then kbd:[Shift]-clicking the last library in the range.

Each library must have a unique nickname: duplicate library nicknames are not
allowed in the same table. However, nicknames can be duplicated between the
global and project library tables. Libraries in the project table take
precedence over libraries with the same name in the global table.

Library nicknames do not have to be related to the library filename or path. The
colon character (`:`) cannot be used in library nicknames or footprint names
because it is used as a separator between nicknames and footprints.

Each library entry must have a valid path. Paths can be defined as absolute,
relative, or by <<fp-path-variable-substitution,path variable substitution>>.

The appropriate library format must be selected in order for the library to be
properly read. The supported formats are listed above. Only KiCad format
libraries (`.pretty` folders containing `.kicad_mod` files) can be saved. Other
footprint library formats are read-only and must be converted to KiCad format
before you can modify them.

There is an optional description field to add a description of the library
entry. The option field is not used at this time so adding options will
have no effect when loading libraries.

[[fp-path-variable-substitution]]
==== Path Variable Substitution

The footprint library tables support path variable substitution, which
allows you to define path variables containing custom paths to where your
libraries are stored. PATH variable substitution is supported by using
the syntax `${PATH_VAR_NAME}` in the footprint library path.

By default, KiCad defines several path variables which are described in
the xref:../kicad/kicad.adoc#kicad-environment-variables[project manager documentation].
Path variables can be configured in the **Preferences**
-> **Configure Paths...** dialog.

Using path variables in the footprint library tables allows libraries to
be relocated without breaking the footprint library tables, so long as the
path variables are updated when the library location changes.

NOTE: KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from
      older versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from
      the current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
      defined itself. For example, `$\{KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR\}` will
      automatically resolve to the value of `$\{KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR\}` if there
      is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

`${KIPRJMOD}` is a special path variable that always expands to the
absolute path of the current project directory. `${KIPRJMOD}` allows libraries
to be stored in the project folder without having to use an absolute path in the
project library table. This makes it possible to relocate projects without
breaking their project library tables.

==== Using the GitHub Plugin

NOTE: KiCad removed support for the GitHub library plugin in version 6.0.

[[migrating-footprint-libraries]]
==== Migrating footprint libraries to KiCad format

Non-KiCad format libraries, including legacy libraries (`.mod` files), are
read-only. They need to be converted to KiCad format (`.kicad_mod` files in a
`.pretty` folder) before you can save changes to them.

NOTE: As with most KiCad files, newer versions of KiCad can open older-format
      library files, but older versions of KiCad cannot read files once they
      have been saved by a newer version of KiCad.

Libraries in other formats can be converted to KiCad libraries by selecting them
in the footprint library table and clicking the **Migrate Libraries** button.
Multiple libraries can be selected and migrated at once by kbd:[Ctrl]-clicking
or kbd:[shift]-clicking.

Libraries can also be converted one at a time by opening them in the Footprint
Editor and saving them as a new library.

[[creating-and-editing-footprints]]
=== Creating and editing footprints

A footprint is the physical interface between a component package and a circuit
board. Footprints can contain:

- Pads, which define how the component will be physically assembled onto the
  footprint. When a footprint is added to a board, tracks are routed to pads,
  and pads provide a magnetic snapping point for the router to connect the pad
  to a track. Pad shapes and layers are fully customizable, and pads can have
  plated holes, unplated holes, or no hole.
- Graphic shapes and text for technical or aesthetic purposes. Graphics can be
  placed on physical layers (e.g. silkscreen or soldermask) or nonphysical
  layers. Graphic shapes can also be placed on copper layers, in which case they
  can make electrical connections.
- 3D models for mechanical CAD and visualization. 3D models are normally
  external files that footprints can link to, but they can optionally be
  embedded in footprints.
- Metadata associated with the footprint.

Footprints in KiCad are organized into footprint libraries, which contain zero
or more footprints. Generally footprints are logically grouped by footprint
category, function, and/or manufacturer. Each library is a folder (usually
ending in `.pretty`) containing a `.kicad_mod` file for each footprint in the
library.

==== Footprint editor overview

KiCad provides a footprint editing tool that allows you to create footprint
libraries; add, edit, delete, or transfer footprints between libraries; export
footprints to files; and import footprints from files. The Footprint Editor can
be launched from the KiCad Project Manager or from the Board Editor (**Tools**
-> **Footprint Editor**). You can also open the Footprint Editor from the
<<board-editing-footprints,a footprint in the board>>; in this way you can edit either the library copy or the board copy of that footprint in the editor.

NOTE: Editing the library version of a footprint will not affect any
      copies of that footprint that have been added to a board until the board
      copy is updated from the library. Conversely, editing the board version of
      a footprint will not affect the library version of a footprint or any
      other copies of that footprint in a board.

The Footprint Editor main window is shown below. It has three toolbars for
quick access to common features and a footprint viewing/editing canvas. Not all
commands are available on the toolbars, but all commands are available in the
menus.

In addition to the toolbars, there are collapsible panels for the footprint tree
and Properties Manager (not shown) on the left, and the appearance panel and
selection filter on the right. The bottom of the window contains a message panel
that shows details about the selected object.

===== Top toolbar

The main toolbar is at the top of the main window. It has buttons for the
undo/redo commands, zoom commands, footprint/pad properties dialogs, and
layer/grid management controls.

==== Browsing, modifying, and saving footprints

The image:images/icons/search_tree_24.png[Footprint tree icon] button displays
or hides the list of available libraries, which allows you to select an active
library. When a new footprint is created, it will be placed in the active
library.

Clicking on a footprint name opens that footprint in the editor, and hovering
the cursor over the name of a footprint displays a preview of the footprint.

After modification, a footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library. To save the modified footprint in the current library, click
the image:images/icons/save_24.png[Save icon] button.

To save the footprint changes to a new footprint, click **File** ->
**Save As...**.  The footprint can be saved in the current library or a
different library, and a new name can be set for the footprint.

To create a new file containing only the current footprint, click **File** ->
**Export** -> **Footprint...**. This file will be a standard footprint library
which will contain only one footprint.

The editor can also open footprints from the board. To edit a footprint from the
board, right click a footprint in the Board Editor and select
**Open in Footprint Editor** (kbd:[Ctrl+E]). Alternatively, you can open a board
footprint by pressing the image:images/icons/load_module_board_24.png[] button
in the Footprint Editor top toolbar and selecting the desired footprint.

Editing and saving the board copy of a footprint will only update that footprint
in the board; it will not update other copies of that footprint in the board,
and it will not change the original library copy of the footprint. When you open
the board copy of a footprint, the Footprint Editor displays an info bar that
warns you the library copy will not be modified. You can click the link in this
info bar to open the library version of the footprint instead, or press
kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+E].

==== Creating a new footprint library

You can create a new footprint library by clicking **File** ->
**New Library...**. At this point you must choose whether the new library should
be added to the global footprint library table or the project footprint library
table. Libraries in the global library table will be available to all projects,
while libraries in the project library table will only be available in the
current project.

image::images/footprint_editor_new_library.png[]

Following selection of the library table, you must choose a name and location
for the new library. A new, empty library will be created at the specified
location.

==== Creating a new footprint

To create a new footprint in the current footprint library, click the
image:images/icons/new_footprint_24.png[New Footprint icon] button or click
**File** -> **New Footprint...**. A new, untitled footprint will be created in
the selected library.

To set the name of the footprint, open its
<<footprint-editor-properties,properties dialog>>
(image:images/icons/module_options_24.png[] button or kbd:[E]).
The name will set the name of the footprint, which is used when assigning a
footprint to a symbol, and is also used as the filename of the footprint file on
disk.

The new footprint will be empty except for several default text items. The
footprint contains two default (mandatory) footprint fields, `Reference` and
`Value`. `Reference` contains the text `REF{asterisk}{asterisk}`, which will be
replaced with the reference designator of the footprint's corresponding symbol
when the <<starting-from-a-schematic,footprint is added to the board>>. `Value`
is initially set to `Untitled`, which can be changed, but this will also be updated with the
contents of the corresponding symbol's `Value` field when the footprint is added
to the board. Finally, there is a footprint text item containing the string
`${REFERENCE}`, which is a <<text-variable,text variable>> that will resolve to
the value of the footprint's `Reference` field once the footprint is on a board.

image::images/footprint_editor_empty_footprint.png[]

These items are centered on the footprint's anchor (origin point), which is
indicated with a magenta cross symbol. The anchor can be repositioned (changing
the `(0, 0)` point for the footprint) by selecting the
image:images/icons/anchor_24.png[Anchor icon] button and clicking on the new
desired anchor position.

NOTE: Rather than manually creating a footprint, for some common footprints you
      can use a <<footprint-wizards,footprint wizard>> to create a footprint
      based on a set of parameters.

[[footprint-editor-properties]]
==== Editing footprint properties

Footprints have a number of properties and metadata items that can be defined.
These include text fields, attributes that can be set or not (such as Do Not
Populate), clearance and zone connection settings, and 3D model paths. These are
initially defined in the library copy of the footprint, but they can be modified
on a per-instance basis once a footprint is added to a board. In other words,
two copies of the same footprint on a single board can their properties edited
separately.

Some properties, namely text fields and attributes, will be automatically set
for each footprint in a board based on the fields and attributes in the
footprint's corresponding schematic symbol. Fields and attributes are synced
from symbols to footprints when you perform the
<<forward-and-back-annotation,Update PCB From Schematic>> action. They are also
synced from footprints back to symbols when you perform the Update Schematic
From PCB action.

image::images/footprint_editor_properties.png[]

To edit footprint properties, click the image:images/icons/module_options_24.png[]
button to show the Footprint Properties dialog. You can also double click an
empty spot in the editing canvas.

===== Footprint name, description, and keywords

The footprint name, description, and keywords describe the footprint itself.
Together they are intended to describe the footprint and help you select an
appropriate footprint for each component. They are also used when searching for
footprints in the Footprint Editor and the Add Footprint dialog.

The **footprint name** contains the name of the footprint. This is the same as
the footprint's filename on disk, and is also initially the same as the
footprint's `Value` field. However, the `Value` field can be edited in the
footprint editor, and when a footprint is added to a board, its `Value` field
will be updated with the value of the footprint's corresponding symbol.

The **description** is a description of the footprint. It should be human
readable, but it is also used when searching for a footprint.

NOTE: This description property is specifically a description of the
      *footprint*. This is not to be confused with the `Description` field,
      which will be set to the description of the footprint's corresponding
      *symbol* when the footprint is added to a board.

The **keywords** are space-separated words related to the footprint. They are
used when searching for a footprint.

===== Footprint fields

Footprints contain multiple fields, which are named values containing
information related to the footprint. Fields can be visible and shown on any
board layer, or they can be hidden and only shown in the footprint's properties.
Some fields have special meaning to KiCad: `Reference` and `Footprint` are both
both used by KiCad to identify schematic symbols and PCB footprints, for
example. Other fields may contain information that is important for a design but
is not interpreted by KiCad, like pricing or stock information for a part.

Any fields defined in a library footprint will be included in the footprint when
it is added to a board. You can also add new fields to footprints in the board.
Whether they are in the library footprint or not, these fields can then be
edited on a per-footprint basis in the board. Symbol fields are also transferred
to the board and added as fields in the corresponding footprint.

NOTE: Footprint fields are different than graphic text. Fields are named, i.e.
      they have both a name (`Reference`) and a value (`R101`), whereas
      footprint text only has a value. Fields can be added to and deleted from
      footprints in a board in the Footprint Properties dialog, while text items
      can only be added to a footprint in the footprint editor. Fields are also
      synced between footprints and their corresponding symbols in the
      schematic. Before KiCad version 8.0, footprints did not have named fields,
      only graphic text.

All library footprints are defined with four default fields which correspond to
the xref:../eeschema/eeschema.adoc#symbol-properties[default fields in library symbols]:
`Reference`, `Value`, `Datasheet`, and `Description`. These default
fields cannot be deleted. The `Reference` field initially has the value `REF**`,
while the `Value` field is initially set to the name of the
footprint. In the board, the values of the four default fields will be set to
the values of the matching fields in the footprint's corresponding symbol.

NOTE: The `Description` footprint field is the description of the symbol, not
      the footprint, and will be overwritten by the value of the corresponding
      symbol's description. Footprints have a separate footprint description
      property (not a field), which is specifically intended for a description
      of the footprint.

Fields each have an associated layer, which determines which board layer the
field will be placed on. Fields can also be visible or hidden.

To edit an existing footprint field, double-click the field, select it or hover
and press kbd:[E], or right-click on the field text and select **Properties...**.

To add new fields, delete optional fields, or edit existing fields, use the
image:images/icons/module_options_24.png[] icon on the main tool bar to open the
Footprint Properties dialog. Fields can be arbitrarily named, but names starting
with `ki_`, e.g. `ki_description`, are reserved by KiCad and should not be used
for user fields.

Fields have a number of properties, each of which is shown as a column in the
properties grid. Not all columns are shown by default; columns can be shown or
hidden by right clicking on the grid header and selecting or deselecting columns
from the menu.

[[footprint-attributes]]
===== Footprint attributes

Footprints have several attributes, which are properties of the footprint that
affect how it is handled by other parts of KiCad.

Every footprint has a **component type**: **SMD**, **Through hole**, or
**Unspecified**. A footprint's type affects KiCad's behavior in a few ways:

* Footprint type controls the default type of new pads added to the footprint.
  For *through hole* and *Unspecified* footprints, new pads will be through hole
  by default, although they can be changed after creation. For *SMD* footprints,
  new pads will be SMD by default.
* Footprint type can be used to filter footprints from component placement files
  as well as other exports, such as STEP files. Additionally, the footprint type
  is included as metadata in IPC-2581 exports.
* Footprint 3D models can be shown and hidden in the 3D viewer based on their
  type. For example, SMD models can be hidden while through hole models are
  still displayed.
* Footprints of different types are reported separately in the
  <<board-statistics,Board Statistics dialog>>.
* DRC will report footprints containing pads that do not match the parent
  footprint's type, for example through hole pads in an SMD footprint.

If **not in schematic** is checked, KiCad will not expect the footprint to
correspond to a symbol in the schematic. When updating a PCB from the schematic,
KiCad will ordinarily remove footprints that don't have corresponding symbols
according to the **delete footprints with no symbols** setting. However, such
footprints will not be deleted when they have **not in schematic** set.

If **exclude from POS files** is checked, KiCad will not include the footprint
in component placement file exports.

If **exclude from bill of materials** is checked, the component will not be
included in bill of materials exports in either the schematic or PCB editors.
This attribute is synced to and from the footprint's corresponding schematic
symbol.

If **exempt from courtyard requirement** is checked, the footprint will not
trigger a DRC violation if it does not contain a courtyard. Without this
attribute set, a footprint without graphics on the `F.Courtyard` or
`B.Courtyard` layer will cause a "Footprint has no courtyard defined" DRC
violation.

The **do not populate** attribute is primarily a schematic symbol attribute, and
is synced to and from the footprint's corresponding schematic symbol. Footprints
with this attribute set can optionally be excluded from component placement file
exports and some other types of outputs. These footprints can also be hidden in
the 3D viewer.

===== Private footprint layers

Footprints can have private footprint layers, which are layers that can be
viewed and edited in the Footprint Editor but are not shown in the footprint
when it is added to a board. Therefore any objects that are on private layers
will not be visible in the PCB Editor or included in PCB fabrication outputs.
This may be useful, for example, for notes or graphics that are of interest when
drawing or editing a footprint but not needed at the board level.

Any of the existing `User.*` layers (`User.Drawings`, `User.Comments`,
`User.Eco1`, `User.1`, etc.) can optionally be a private layer. To make a layer
private, add a private layer in the **General** tab of the footprint properties
dialog, then select the desired layer. Any objects on that layer will not be
shown on the board.

===== Clearance overrides and settings

The **Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab holds settings for
footprint-specific overrides to board clearance and mask/paste expansion,
pad-to-zone connections, and net tie settings for allowing pads within the
footprint to short different nets.

image::images/footprint_editor_properties_clearance.png[]

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the footprint's pads and any copper shape
(tracks, vias, pads, zones) on a different net.  This value is normally empty, which will cause
the pad clearance to be inherited from the board's design rules and netclass rules. This value can
be overridden for individual pads by setting the pad's clearance to a nonblank value.

NOTE: Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad clearance value to be inherited.
      In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad
      clearance causes the clearance to be inherited.

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape and size as the pad shape on
the copper layer(s).  In the PCB manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the
relative size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but since this size
change is specific to a manufacturing process, most manufacturers expect the design data to be
provided with the apertures set to the same size as the copper pads.  For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the design data, you can use the
settings here. These values can be overridden for individual pads by setting the pad's expansion
or clearance to a nonzero value.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad shape and the aperture shape
on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers.  A positive number means the solder mask aperture will be larger
than the copper shape.  This number is an inflation applied to all directions.  For example, a
value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that
there will be an `0.1mm` border on all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm`
wider than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between the pad shape and the
aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.  Its behavior is otherwise identical to the
behavior of the **solder mask expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste clearance value as a percentage
of the pad size rather than an absolute distance value.  If both relative and absolute clearances
are specified, they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

**Pad connection to zones** controls whether the footprint's pads will have solid, thermal relief,
or no connection to zones.  Like the other overrides, this one may be set for an individual pad or
for an entire footprint.  The default setting for this control is **From zone setting**, which uses
the connection mode specified in the connection zones' properties. This setting can be overridden
for individual pads by setting the pad's connection mode to a value other than
**From parent footprint**.

[[net-ties]]
====== Creating net ties

Footprints can act as net ties, where two separate nets are electrically connected by copper.
Connecting nets together would normally causes a DRC error due to violating the clearance between
two nets, but a footprint can be configured to short nets without causing a DRC violation.
This can be used to connect multiple grounds at a specific location, to make kelvin sense
connections to a component, or for other applications.

image::images/net_tie_group.png[]

Net ties connect two or more nets in one contiguous region of copper. Each net in a net tie must
have its own pad. Pads are not ordinarily allowed to short to other pads; to allow pads to be
shorted in net ties, the shorting pads must be added to a *net tie group*. To create a net tie
group, add the pad numbers of the shorting pads to the **Net Ties** table in the
**Clearance Overrides and Settings** tab of the Footprint Properties dialog. For example, to
allow pads `1` and `2` to short in a footprint, add a line to the table with the contents `1,2`.

After creating a net tie group, the specified pads are allowed to be electrically shorted. Pads in
net tie groups can be connected either by directly overlapping the pads or by adding a copper
shape that overlaps both pads.

Footprints can contain multiple net tie groups. Each group can short two or more nets, but every
group must remain electrically separate from other groups.

[[footprint-3d-models]]
===== 3D models

The **3D Models** tab allows you to attach external 3D model files to a
footprint and view the footprint in three dimensions along with any attached
models.

image::images/footprint_editor_properties_3dmodels.png[]

The main part of the window is a 3D preview of the footprint and any attached
models. The buttons to the right of the preview let you enable or disable
an orthographic projection (image:images/icons/ortho_16.png[]), show or hide the
PCB model (image:images/icons/axis3d_16.png[]), align the view to one of the six
face-aligned perspectives (image:images/icons/axis3d_left_16.png[]), and refresh
the view (image:images/icons/refresh_16.png[]). The bottom button
(image:images/icons/options_3drender_16.png[]) lets you set the thickness of the
PCB in the preview.

The top of the dialog lets you attach external models. Each added model will
be shown in the footprint preview as well as in the full PCB 3D view when the
footprint is added to a board. Footprint models can be in STEP, VRML, or
<<idf-component-outlines,IDF>> format. The models are specified as paths to the
model files, which can contain xref:../kicad/kicad.adoc#path-variables[path variables]
such as `${KIPRJMOD}` or `${KICAD9_3DMODEL_DIR}`. Click the **Configure Paths**
button to configure path variables. If there is a problem loading a model file
from the specified path, an icon in the leftmost column will indicate an error.

NOTE: KiCad will automatically resolve versioned path variables from
      older versions of KiCad to the value of the corresponding variable from
      the current KiCad version, as long as the old variable is not explicitly
      defined itself. For example, `$\{KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR\}` will
      automatically resolve to the value of `$\{KICAD9_FOOTPRINT_DIR\}` if there
      is no `KICAD8_FOOTPRINT_DIR` variable defined.

NOTE: Many footprints in KiCad's standard library do not yet have model files
      created for them. However, these footprints may contain a path to a 3D
      model that does not yet exist, in anticipation of the 3D model being
      created in the future.

By default, models are added with their origin placed at the footprint's origin,
with no offset, scaling, or rotation. Offset, scaling, and rotation can be
applied to a model using the controls to the left of the preview canvas. The
model's opacity can be adjusted using the **opacity** slider, and the model can
be completely hidden by deselecting the **show** checkbox in the rightmost
column of the model table.

[[fp-embedding-files]]
==== Embedding files in footprints

External files can be embedded within a footprint.
Embedding a file stores a copy of the file inside the footprint. The footprint
can then refer to the embedded copy of the file instead of the external file,
which makes the footprint more portable as it doesn't rely on an external file,
although the footprint's filesize is increased as a result.
In footprints this is especially useful for embedding 3D models. Files embedded
in a footprint are deduplicated when the footprint is added to a board: if a
file is embedded in a footprint, and multiple instances of that footprint are
added to the board, only one copy of the file will be embedded, and all of the
footprint instances will refer to the same embedded file. Files embedded in a
footprint cannot be referred to in the parent board. File embedding is explained
in more detail in the <<pcb-embedding-files,Board Setup documentation>>.

image::images/fp_embedded_files.png[]

NOTE: You can add a 3D model to a footprint and embed it in one step. To do so,
      add a 3D model in the **3D Models**, and enable the **Embed File**
      checkbox in the file browser while choosing a model. This embeds the
      file and automatically uses the embedded reference as the file path
      instead of the path to the external file.

[[footprint-pads]]
==== Footprint pads

Pads are added to a footprint by clicking the image:images/icons/pad_24.png[] button in the
right toolbar, then clicking again in the desired location in the canvas. The tool continues
adding new pads each time you click on the canvas until you cancel the tool (kbd:[Esc]).

New pads have their pad type set by the <<footprint-attributes,footprint's type>>, though you can
change the pad type later. New pads in SMD footprints are SMD by default, while pads in Through Hole
and Unspecified footprints are through hole. Each new pad has its pad number incremented by 1 relative
to the previous pad number.

[[footprint-pad-properties]]
===== Pad properties

You can edit a pad after adding it by opening the pad's properties dialog (kbd:[E]). These
properties are also editable using the <<editing-object-properties,Properties Manager>>.

====== General tab

The **General** tab of the pad properties dialog shows the physical properties of the pad, including
its geometry, shape, and layer settings.

image::images/pad_properties_general.png[scaledwidth="70%"]

**Pad type:** this setting controls which features are enabled for the pad:

* **SMD** pads are electrically-connected and have no hole.  In other words, they exist on a single
  copper layer.

* **Through-hole** pads are electrically-connected and have a plated hole.  The hole exists on every
  layer, and the copper pad exists on multiple layers (see **Copper layers** setting below).

* **Edge Connector** pads are SMD pads that are allowed to overlap the board outline on the
  `Edge.Cuts` layer.

* **NPTH, Mechanical** pads are non-plated through holes that do not have an electrical connection.

* **SMD Aperture** pads are pads that have no hole and no electrical connection.  These can be used
  to add specific designs to a technical layer, for example a paste or solder mask aperture.

The **Copper layers** setting controls which copper layers will have a shape associated with the
pad.

For SMD pads, the options are `F.Cu` or `B.Cu`, controlling whether the pad sits on the front or
the back of the board _relative to the footprint's location_.  In other words, if a pad is set to
exist on `B.Cu` in its properties, and the footprint is flipped to the back of the board, _that pad
will now exist on `F.Cu`, because it also has been flipped_.

For through-hole pads, it is possible to remove the pad shape from copper layers where the pad is
not electrically connected to other copper (tracks or filled zones).  Setting the copper layers to
**connected layers only** will remove the pad shape from any unconnected layers, and setting to
**`F.Cu`, `B.Cu`, and connected layers** will remove the pad shape from any internal unconnected
layers.  This can be useful in dense board designs to increase the routable area on internal
layers.

The **Technical layers** checkboxes control which technical layers will have an aperture added with
the pad's shape.  By default, pads have apertures on the paste and mask layers matching their
copper layer.

NOTE: It is not possible to define a different pad shape or size on different copper layers in the
      current version of KiCad.

The **Pad number** controls what the pad will be electrically connected to in the board. A pad has
the same net connection as the pin with the same number in the corresponding schematic symbol.

Pad **Position X** and **Y** are the location of the center of the pad, relative to the footprint's
origin.

**Pad shape** controls the basic shape of the pad. This can be *circular*, *oval*, *rectangular*,
*trapezoidal*, *rounded rectangle*, *chamfered rectangle*, *chamfered with other corners rounded*,
*custom (circular base)*, or *custom (rectangular base)*. Each pad shape has its own set of
options; for example, rounded rectangles have settings for *pad size X* and *Y*, *angle*,
*corner size*, and *corner radius*.

NOTE: The size of a pad can also be adjusted interactively in the canvas by dragging the editing
      handles at the pad corners.

Through-hole and NPTH pads have a hole in addition to the pad itself. The **hole shape** can be
*circular* or *oval*, with corresponding size controls. By default the pad is centered on the
hole, but the pad can be offset relative to the hole if the **offset shape from hole** option
is enabled (circular pads cannot be offset from the hole).

**Fabrication properties** are primarily used as metadata in Gerber X2 fabrication output, where
the fabrication property is included as an aperture attribute for each pad. Some properties also
affect DRC. The following fabrication properties are available:

* *BGA pad* can only be applied to SMD pads, and only affects Gerber X2 output.

* *Fiducial, local to footprint* and *fiducial, global to board* only affect Gerber X2 output.

* *Test point* can only be applied to SMD or through hole pads, can only be applied to pads on
  outer layers, and only affects Gerber X2 output.

* Through hole pads with the *heatsink pad* property are allowed
  in SMD footprints (PTH pads without this property cause a DRC violation when
  they are used in SMD footprints). It also affects Gerber X2 output.

* The *castellated pad* property is for pads that intentionally intersect the board edge such that
  they will be bisected when the board is manufactured. Pads with this property are allowed to
  intersect the board edge and still be routed (it is otherwise a DRC error for a pad to intersect
  the board edge, which makes routing impossible). In STEP exports, pads with this property are
  clipped to the board edge. This property also affects Gerber X2 output.

* Through hole pads with the *mechanical* property can be used in SMD footprints
  without causing a DRC violation. This can be used for mounting pads or other
  mechanical through hole pads in surface mount footprints. This is similar to the
  *heatsink pad* property, but does not affect Gerber X2 output.

* *None* is for pads for which none of the other fabrication properties apply. It has no effect.

**Specify pad to die length:** This setting allows a length to be associated with this pad that
will be added to the routed track length by the track length tuning tools and the Net Inspector.
This can be used to specify internal bondwire lengths for more accurate length matching, or in
other situations where the electrical length of a net is longer than the length of the routed
tracks on the board.

====== Connections tab

The **Connections** tab contains settings for how pads connect to other objects, including
settings for teardrops, zone connections, and thermal reliefs.

image::images/pad_properties_connections.png[]

The Teardrops section contains settings controlling teardrop connections between tracks and the
pad, if teardrops are used. Teardrop settings are explained in the
<<editing-teardrops,teardrop documentation>>.

**Pad connection** controls whether the pad will have a solid, thermal relief, or no connection to
the zone.  Like the other overrides, this one may be set for an individual pad or for an entire
footprint.  The default setting for this control is **From parent footprint**, and the default
footprint setting is to use the connection mode specified in the zone properties.

**Zone knockout** controls the behavior of the zone filler when the pad uses a custom
shape rather than one of the default shapes.  This can be used to achieve different results when
using thermal reliefs and custom pad shapes.

**Relief gap** controls the length of the thermal spokes, or the gap between the pad's shape and
the filled copper area of the zone. This value is normally empty which will cause the relief
gap to be inherited from the connecting zone's settings.

**Spoke width** controls the width of the spokes generated when the zone connection mode is
**Thermal Relief**. This value is normally empty which will cause the spoke width to be
inherited from the connecting zone's settings.

NOTE: Prior to KiCad version 9, a relief gap or spoke width of `0` caused that value to be inherited.
      In KiCad 9 and later, a relief gap or spoke width of `0` sets that value to `0`, while a blank
      value causes the value to be inherited.

====== Clearance Overrides tab

The **Clearance Overrides** tab holds settings for pad-specific overrides to board clearance and
mask/paste expansion.

image::images/pad_properties_overrides.png[scaledwidth="70%"]

**Pad clearance** controls the minimum clearance between the pad and any copper shape (tracks,
vias, pads, zones) on a different net.  This value is normally empty which will cause the pad
clearance to be inherited from any clearance override set on the footprint, or the board's design
rules and netclass rules if the footprint clearance is also empty.

NOTE: Prior to KiCad version 9, a pad clearance of `0` caused the pad clearance value to be inherited.
      In KiCad 9 and later, a pad clearance of `0` sets the clearance to `0`, while a blank pad
      clearance causes the clearance to be inherited.

The aperture appearing on any technical layer will have the same shape and size as the pad shape on
the copper layer(s).  In the PCB manufacturing process, the manufacturer will often change the
relative size of mask and paste apertures relative to the copper pad size, but since this size
change is specific to a manufacturing process, most manufacturers expect the design data to be
provided with the apertures set to the same size as the copper pads.  For specific situations where
you need to oversize or undersize a technical layer aperture in the design data, you can use the
settings here.

**Solder mask expansion** controls the size difference between the pad shape and the aperture shape
on the F.Mask and B.Mask layers.  A positive number means the solder mask aperture will be larger
than the copper shape.  This number is an inflation applied to all directions.  For example, a
value of `0.1mm` here will cause the solder mask aperture to be inflated by `0.1mm`, meaning that
there will be an `0.1mm` border on all sides of the pad and the solder mask opening will be `0.2mm`
wider than the pad when measured along a given axis.

**Solder paste absolute clearance** controls the size difference between the pad shape and the
aperture shape on the F.Paste and B.Paste layers.  Its behavior is otherwise identical to the
behavior of the **solder mask expansion** setting.

**Solder paste relative clearance** allows setting a solder paste clearance value as a percentage
of the pad size rather than an absolute distance value.  If both relative and absolute clearances
are specified, they are added together to determine the solder paste aperture size.

===== Working with multiple pads

When you place a new pad, the new pad's properties are copied from the
*default pad properties*. Each time any pad is edited, the pad's updated
properties are stored as the default pad properties, so that new pads will match
the properties of the most recently edited pad.

You can directly edit the default pad properties by selecting **Edit** ->
**Default Pad Properties...**, or choose an existing pad to represent the
default by right clicking the pad and choosing
**Copy Pad Properties to Default**. New pads will use that pad's properties as
their defaults until a new default is selected, either by editing another pad,
editing the default pad properties, or manually copying a different pad's
properties to the default.

There are several ways to update existing pads with the properties of other
pads. You can apply the default pad properties to an explicit selection of pads
by selecting the desired target pads, right clicking, and choosing
**Paste Default Pad Properties to Selected** from the right click context menu.
You can also update other pads with a selected pad's properties using
**Push Default Pad Properties to Other Pads...**, also in the right click
context menu.

image::images/push_pad_properties.png[]

This tool has several options to filter which pads are targeted.

If **do not modify pads having a different shape** is selected, only pads with
the exact same shape properties as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads having different layers** is selected, only pads on the
same layer(s) as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads having a different orientation** is selected, only pads
with the same orientation as the selected pad will be updated.

If **do not modify pads pads having a different type** is selected, only pads
with the same pad type as the selected pad will be updated.

If no options are selected, all pads in the footprint will be updated.

You can create an array of pads from a source pad by right clicking the source
pad and selecting **Create from Selection** -> **Create Array...**
(kbd:[Ctrl+T]). The basic functionality of this tool is described in the
<<creating-arrays,PCB Editor documentation>>. For pads, however, there are
additional options for controlling pad numbering.

image::images/create_array_pads_grid.png[]

For grid arrays, you can select a numbering direction, either
**horizontal, then vertical** or **vertical, then horizontal**. If
**reverse numbering on alternate rows/columns** is selected, the direction of
increasing pad numbers will alternate from one row/column to the next.

The initial pad number in the array can either be the first unused pad number in
the footprint (**use first free number**) or the specified
**pad numbering start** value. After the first number, the pad numbering can
either be **continuous** (1, 2, 3, ...) or **coordinate** based, in other words,
dependent on both the row and column (A1, A2, ..., B1, ...). In addition to the
initial pad number (**pad numbering start**), you can specify a numbering step
(**pad numbering skip**). For coordinate-based numbering, you can configure
separate starting numbers and steps for each axis. You can select whether pad
numbers use decimal digits (0-9), hexadecimal digits (0-F), the full alphabet,
or the alphabet excepting certain ambiguous letters (I, O, S, Q, X, and Z).

Finally, you can quickly renumber existing pads using the Renumber Pads tool
(**Edit** -> **Renumber Pads...**).

image::images/renumber_pads.png[]

The tool has several options. Pads will be renumbered starting at the selected
**first pad number**, and each subsequent pad will have its number incremented
by the **numbering step**. You can also choose an optional **pad name prefix**
which will be inserted before of the incrementing part of each pad number.

Once you click **OK**, you will be prompted to click on a pad, which will be
assigned a new pad number based on the selected initial pad number and prefix.
You can keep clicking on pads to assign them the next number in the sequence
based on the selected numbering step. Double click on a pad to renumber that pad
and end the sequence, or press kbd:[Esc] to discard the changes.

[[custom-pad-shapes]]
===== Custom pad shapes

For some footprints, the built-in pad shapes (round, rectangular, etc.) may not
be sufficient. In these cases you can construct custom pads with arbitrary
shapes using *Pad Edit Mode*. This mode lets you combine a basic pad with
graphic shapes to build a new pad out of the compound shape.

To build a custom pad, first add a regular pad using the pad tool
(image:images/icons/pad_24.png[] button). This base pad will become the custom
pad's anchor or snapping point, so be sure to place the pad in the exact
location where you want tracks to attach to the pad. The shape and size of the
pad do not matter, but the hole, if any, will remain in the final custom pad. In
other words, a surface mount base pad will result in a surface mount custom pad,
and a through hole base pad will result in a through hole custom pad. The custom
pad's number will be inherited from the base pad.

Next, enter Pad Edit Mode by selecting the base pad, right-clicking, and
selecting **Edit Pad as Graphic Shapes** (kbd:[Ctrl+E]). Add graphic shapes as
appropriate to create the desired pad shape. Shapes touching the base pad will
be unioned together with the base pad to create the final pad shape.

You can exit Pad Edit Mode by right-clicking and selecting **Finish Pad Edit**,
or pressing kbd:[Ctrl+E] again. When you exit pad edit mode, all shapes that
touch the base pad will be combined with the pad. For example, when editing a
surface mount pad on `F.Cu`, any shapes that are on `F.Cu` and touch the base
pad will become part of the custom pad. Any shapes that do not overlap the base
pad, or that are on a different layer, will remain separate. If the base pad is
a through hole pad, overlapping shapes on `F.Cu` will be combined in the custom
pad. Because through hole pads have the same pad shape on all copper layers,
this shape will become part of the custom pad on all copper layers, not just
`F.Cu`. For convenience, Pad Edit Mode dims the color of other pads and all
shapes that are not contiguous with the base pad so that you can see which
shapes will be included in the custom pad and which will not.

Custom pads can only contain a single base pad. Any additional pads that touch
the base pad or the contiguous graphics, whether they have the same or different
pad numbers as the base pad, will remain separate pads after the shapes are
combined into the custom pad.

NOTE: If you would like to add multiple anchors (snapping points) to a custom
      pad, you can add additional separate pads on top of the custom pad. Create
      the custom pad as normal, containing the first snapping point, then add
      additional pads with the same number and place them overlapping the custom
      pad in the desired snapping locations. They will remain distinct pads and
      will not be combined with the custom pad, but they will act as additional
      pad anchors and will be electrically connected to the custom pad.

To modify an existing custom pad, select it and enter Pad Edit Mode again. You
can then continue to edit the component shapes to adjust the pad shape, or
change the position of the base pad to adjust the pad anchor.

KiCad automatically chooses a size and location for showing the pad number over
the pad. Particularly for unusually shaped pads, the automatically determined
size and location may not be optimal. In these cases, you can manually specify a
region in which KiCad should draw the pad number by adding a pad **number box**
primitive. To add a number box, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a rectangular shape.
In the Properties Manager for the rectangle, check the **Number Box** checkbox.
The rectangle will then be shown as a wireframe, and when you exit Pad Edit Mode
it will be used to draw the pad number.

In the board, KiCad will automatically add thermal spokes when connecting the
pad to a zone. The thermal spoke settings are determined by the pad, footprint,
and zone settings, and the thermal spokes by default connect to the pad anchor.
You can override the default thermal spoke placement by adding
**thermal relief templates** to the custom pad. To add a thermal relief
template, enter Pad Edit Mode and add a line shape. In the Properties Manager
for the line, check the **Thermal Relief Template** checkbox. In Pad Edit Mode,
the line will then be shown as a wireframe, and it will not be shown outside of
pad edit mode. If any thermal relief templates are present in the pad, KiCad
will not automatically add additional spokes when filling zones; spokes will
only be placed where there are thermal relief templates defined in the pad.
Thermal relief templates only determine the spoke location: spoke width and
relief gap are still defined in the pad, footprint, and/or zone properties, as
normal.

[[fp-graphical-objects]]
==== Footprint graphics and text

Footprints can contain graphic shapes, text, and dimensions. These objects can
be placed on nonphysical layers, like `F.Fab` or `User.Drawings`, or they can be
placed on layers that will be part of the manufactured circuit board, such as
`Edge.Cuts` or a silkscreen, soldermask, or copper layer. Objects on copper
layers can make electrical connections.

Closed shapes on a footprint's `F.Courtyard` and `B.Courtyard` layers will form
the footprint's front and back courtyard, respectively. A courtyard defines the
physical extents of a footprint and limits where footprints are allowed to be
placed in relation to other footprints. If a footprint's courtyard overlaps
another footprint's courtyard, a DRC violation will be generated.

Shapes on a footprint's `Edge.Cuts` layer will correspond to board edges on any
PCB that includes the footprint. Closed shapes will result in cutouts, while
unclosed shapes will result in unclosed edges. Unclosed edges must be closed in
the full board design.

The buttons on the right toolbar can be used to create:

* Lines (image:images/icons/add_line_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+L])
* Arcs (image:images/icons/add_arc_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+A])
* Bezier curves (image:images/icons/add_bezier_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+B])
* Rectangles (image:images/icons/add_rectangle_24.png[])
* Circles (image:images/icons/add_circle_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+C])
* Polygons (image:images/icons/add_graphical_polygon_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P])
* Text (image:images/icons/text_24.png[], default hotkey kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T])
* Textboxes (image:images/icons/add_textbox_24.png[])
* Tables (image:images/icons/table_24.png[])
* Dimensions (image:images/icons/add_aligned_dimension_24.png[]), of which
  several types are available

NOTE: You can customize the default style of newly-created text and shape objects in
      **Preferences** -> **Footprint Editor** -> **Default Values**.

Graphical objects and their properties are described in more detail in the
<<pcb-graphical-objects,PCB Editor documentation>>.

===== Bulk editing footprint text and graphics

Properties of text and graphics can be edited in bulk using the *Edit Text and
Graphics Properties* dialog (**Edit** -> **Edit Text & Graphic Properties...**).

image::images/edit_text_and_graphics_properties_footprint.png[]

This dialog is described in more detail in the
<<pcbnew-edit-text-and-graphics-properties,PCB Editor documentation>>.

===== Cleaning up footprint graphics

There is a dedicated tool for performing common cleanup operations on
graphics, which is run via **Tools** -> **Cleanup Graphics...**.

image::images/cleanup_graphics_footprint.png[]

The following cleanup actions are available and will be performed when selected:

*Merge lines into rectangles:* combines individual graphic lines that together
form a rectangle into a single rectangle shape object.

*Delete redundant graphics:* deletes graphics objects that are duplicated or
degenerate.

*Merge overlapping graphics into pads:* merges graphic copper shapes that
overlap pads into a <<custom-pad-shapes,custom pad>>.

Any changes that will be applied to the footprint are displayed at the bottom of
the dialog. They are not applied until you press the **Update Footprint**
button.

[[fp-rule-areas]]
==== Rule areas

Rule areas, also known as keepouts, are footprint regions that can have specific
DRC rules defined for them. Some basic rules are available that will raise DRC
errors if certain types of objects are within the bounds of the rule area, but
rule areas can also be used together with
<<custom-design-rules,custom DRC rules>> to define complex DRC behavior that
only applies within the rule area. A rule area in a footprint takes effect when
the footprint is added to the board.

You can add a rule area by clicking the
image:images/icons/add_keepout_area_24.png[] button on the right toolbar
(kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+K]). Click on the canvas to place the first corner, which will
show the Rule Area Properties dialog. After configuring the rule area
appropriately, press **OK** to continue placing corners of the rule area. The
rule area shape can be an arbitrary polygon; click on the starting corner or
double click to finish placing the rule area.

Rule areas are described in more detail in the <<pcb-rule-areas,PCB editor>>
documentation.

[[fp-reference-images]]
==== Reference images

Just like in the PCB Editor, you can use reference images in the Footprint
Editor to assist with your footprint designs. Footprint reference images are
only shown in the Footprint Editor: they are not shown in the PCB Editor
when a footprint is added to a board, and they do not appear in any fabrication
outputs.

To add a reference image, use the image:images/icons/image_24.png[] button on
the right toolbar and select the desired reference image file.

Reference images are described in more detail in the
<<pcb-reference-images,PCB Editor documentation>>.

[[footprint-wizards]]
==== Footprint wizards

KiCad provides a set of footprint wizards that can be used to create some common
kinds of footprints based on a set of parameters. Wizards for the following
types of footprints are provided:

* BGA packages
* QFN packages
* QFP packages
* SOIC, MSOP, SSOP, TSSOP, etc. packages
* SIP and DIP packages
* ZIP packages
* ZOIC packages
* FPC connectors
* Micromatch SMD connectors
* Circular pad arrays
* Touch sliders
* Mutual capacitance touch buttons
* USS-39 barcodes
* QR codes

To create a footprint using a footprint wizard, click the
image:images/icons/module_wizard_24.png[] button and choose a footprint type
from the list that appears.

image::images/footprint_wizard.png[]

In the window that appears, fill out the parameters as appropriate. When the
parameters are correctly filled out, press the
image:images/icons/export_footprint_names_24.png[] button to transfer the
generated footprint back into the footprint editor. Then you can make additional
manual modifications and save the footprint as normal.

In addition to the set of footprint wizards that KiCad provides, you can also
create your own. For more information about creating new footprint wizards, see
the <<creating-footprint-wizards,Scripting section>> of the Advanced Topics
chapter.

[[checking-footprints]]
==== Checking footprints

The Footprint Editor can check for common issues in your footprints. Run the
footprint checker using the image:images/icons/erc_24.png[] button in the top
toolbar.

image::images/footprint_checker.png[]

Any footprint issues that are detected are listed in the dialog and displayed
with arrow indicators in the editing canvas. Clicking on an issue in the dialog
will focus on the issue in the canvas.

The footprint checker checks for:

* Malformed or missing courtyards
* Pads that don't match the footprint's type: footprints without any through
  hole pads should be set to the surface mount footprint type
* Through hole pads without a hole
* Plated through hole pads not on any copper layers
* Plated through hole pads without a copper annulus
* Plated through hole pads with a hole that isn't fully within the pad
* Surface mount pads on both the front and back
* Surface mount pads with mismatched copper and paste/mask layers (front copper
  and back paste/mask, or vice versa)
* Pads co-located with or too close to other holes
* Collisions between silkscreen and solder mask openings
* Pads that short to other pads outside of net tie groups
* Nonexistent pads in net tie groups
* Pads in that appear in multiple net tie groups

=== Browsing footprint libraries

The Footprint Library Browser allows you to quickly examine the contents of
footprint libraries. The Footprint Library Viewer can be accessed by clicking
image:images/icons/library_browser_24.png[Library viewer icon] icon on the main
Board Editor toolbar or with **View** -> **Footprint Library Browser**.

To examine the contents of a library, select a library from the list in the left
hand pane. All footprints in the selected library will appear in the second
pane. Select a footprint name to view the footprint.

image::images/footprint_library_browser.png[alt="Footprint Library Browser",scaledwidth="95%"]

Double clicking the name of a footprint or using the
image:images/icons/insert_module_board_24.png[Insert footprint in board icon]
button adds the footprint to the board.

The top toolbar contains the following commands:
